<p>Hey everyone,</p>



<p>we are back in business. During the last three months, we have worked at our companies, so we didn’t have time to work on our project. Now we are back, and we&#8217;ve all learned new skills in the meantime. Also, the technologies we use have progressed. Therefore, we have thought about how our project should go on this semester this week.</p>



<h3>Feature &amp; Priority Changes</h3>



<p>Our first point we thought about was whether our features and use cases should stay the same. Together we reviewed our use cases and added some new ones.</p>



<p class="has-background has-subtle-background-background-color">We decided, that we first want to finish our login and account management, because we need this for other features we want to implement.</p>



<p>Then we move on with the other use cases, but we didn’t make the final decision in which order we want to realize them yet. These use cases are the timetable, the meal-plan of the canteen (which is already done), the chat feature, a contacts page, the possibility to find the best train connection and the bets-game.</p>



<p>The new features we add to this list are the chat and the contacts page. Here is a short overview:</p>



<div class="wp-block-columns alignwide">
<div class="wp-block-column is-vertically-aligned-top">
<h6>Chat</h6>



<p class="has-background has-subtle-background-background-color">We want to implement a simple group-chat function for each class. The chats are supposed to be generated automatically with the information from Rapla, but the course speakers shall be able to delete individual chats if the course don’t need them.</p>
</div>



<div class="wp-block-column">
<h6>Contacts page</h6>



<p class="has-background has-subtle-background-background-color">The contacts page is an idea that came out of the current situation with corona. The page shall show the contact information of the lecturers and the students, so that it’s easier to contact and communicate with new lecturers in times like this. But of course, you don’t have to share your private contact information if you don’t want to.</p>
</div>
</div>



<h3>Changes in the Front End</h3>



<p>In January Ionic 5.0.0 was released, so we discussed whether we upgrade our existing project to the latest version or we want to set up a new frontend project.</p>



<p>So, we&#8217;ve researched the differences from our version of Ionic to the latest version. The new version includes new opportunities to design the application and it should be easy to update our project.</p>



<p>The new version updated the UI design elements for iOS, especially for the latest version iOS 13. The <em>swipe to close modal</em> and the possibility to collapse headers easily are only one of the few examples for that. Besides that, Ionic changed their default colors for dark mode and added new icons. And last but not least they redesigned the starter templates.</p>



<p><em>If you want to know more about those changes or how the new design elements look like check out <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://ionicframework.com/blog/announcing-ionic-5/" target="_blank">this link</a>.</em></p>



<div style="height:40px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p>Nevertheless, we decided to set up a new frontend project. But why should we do this?</p>



<p>This question has a fairly simple answer. Our existing project is based on an Ionic Starter template with tabs to navigate through the different pages, which works great with few pages. After we decided to add more features and pages this solution won’t work fine. It is easier to set up a new project with the updated Ionic-starter template that uses another type of navigation.</p>



<p>But we are still not quite sure whether we want to use a menu or some kind of hybrid navigation. We will decide this at the beginning of the next week.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator is-style-dots"/>



<p>That’s it for this week. What do you think about our decisions?</p>



<p>Also check out our new post about our <a href="https://foodies.ginomessmer.me/2020/04/25/a-primer-into-risk-management/">Risk management</a>.</p>



<p>See you next week and stay safe!</p>



<p>Cheers,<br>Isabell</p>

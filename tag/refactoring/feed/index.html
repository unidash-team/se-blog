<p>Welcome to this week’s post about refactoring.</p>



<p>The purpose was to take some classes and lines of code and make them look nicer and more maintainable. Also, we brought every method into the object class where it belongs. It was kind of fun doing these exercises. But we were not sure if we could adopt those measures to our real code of the project as we already tried implementing those rules beforehand. We will see that in the upcoming weeks.</p>



<p>We can give you a short idea of what we were supposed to do and how it came out.</p>



<h2>Fowler</h2>



<p>We talked about what example we should choose and how we wanted to proceed with it. First, we wanted to create a single repository where everyone could work for themselves but we noticed that this would not meet the requirements as we could not run the project due to namespace issues.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So instead, everyone created their own repository. This also had the positive side effect that no one could easily spy on others’ solutions.</p>



<p>We chose the example which was given in Fowler’s text instead of other possible projects from DBWorks as we were not sure how to start with this side project.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We worked on it independently but we were ready to compare results afterwards so we could improve our code.</p>



<p>Here are the links to our repositories:</p>

</div>

<p class="has-small-font-size"><em>Caution: Some links may not work yet because the code was not pushed yet. They will be accessible as soon as the publisher has finished the code.</em></p>



<p>That’s it from us today. Hope you enjoyed reading. We know, our posts are some kind of TLDR the past weeks, but we like writing down our thoughts in a creative way and hope for constructive feedback. If you have any comments please let us know below.</p>



<p>Cheers, stay healthy and have a good one,</p>

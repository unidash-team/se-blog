					<description><![CDATA[Hey guys,
good job this week. We don&#039;t have more to say to your blogpost as The Hopper Team said. We are looking forward to see which tool you will implement in future.
You said you will focus on Security and Quality Assurance. Maybe you can add an explanation of these points  to your blogpost.

Regards,
AniflixApp-Team]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Dear Raw Beans Team,
you have written a nice blog. It&#039;s very nice that you explained many different tools and their usage. Even though you haven&#039;t implemented a specific tool now and so could not show refactored code or specific numbers, it would be nice to hear what specific metrics you want to improve. In this context, you could explain at least two example metrics like duplication or complexity.

We are looking forward to your further progress!
Best regards,
The hopper team]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi,

your blogpost ist quite interesting and it is very well shown what you did. The only thing I miss is a direct comparison of the before and after class diagram.

					<description><![CDATA[Heya Unidash!

First of all, a very nice project name you chose now.
Also, you explained very well on why you use certain patterns and what they should do.
However you may consider adding an overall class diagram to show where exactly those patterns appear in your code.

With best regards
Florian from Itemize]]></description>

Hey Jonas,

thanks for your kind words. We like to be creative for our posts and code but we also got feedback that it may be too long and that some people won&#039;t read too much text concerning the project.

We are actually revising parts of our refactoring code again and actually added .gitignore in that way so for the next commits there shouldn&#039;t be any .idea folders left.
Thanks for the advice.

Keep it up and stay healthy,

-RawBean]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hey Robin,

don&#039;t worry about your blog posts being a TL;DR - I don&#039;t mind at all and even view it as a refresher.

I took a look at your different Fowler git repositories and you seem to be stuck at different stages at the process (which is perfectly fine). I also enjoyed this exercise, one thing I do want to point out however is that you shouldn&#039;t push any artifacts of your development environment to git (e.g. Gino with his .idea folder).

Other than that nice work - I am looking forward to the next post!

Best regards,
Jonas (unitasks)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hey Team Foodies,

I like the idea of using karma for your e2e tests as we are also using Angular with karma and the cucumber tests. I am looking forward to see your implementation of that, feel free to notify us once you update your post :)

Hi Manuel,

thank you for your heads up. We&#039;ve been working on some tests but faced some troubles with Angular and Cucumber along the way. Working on fixing these; we&#039;ll make sure to amend this in the next post.]]></description>

Hi Lukas,
thanks for asking. We’re going to use Azure DevOps for Git, planning and CI/CD. You can read more about it at the end of our previous post if you’re interested: https://blog.foodies.ginomessmer.me/2019/10/our-vision/]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hello Foodies,
I think you did great work with your goals and educations. 

I like how you introduce yourself and how you tell me and others about your lifestyle and story.

Best wishes

					<description><![CDATA[Hello Foodies,
I really like your blog post this week. 
You did a very good job at explaining who got which role and more importantly why you assigned the roles the way they are now.
As for your technology stack , I think it&#039;s a good idea to use state-of-the-art tools and frameworks like Angular.
Do you plan on using some kind of CI environment? 
Cheers,
Lukas@KeyCloud]]></description>

Hi Pascal, thank you for your comment. We haven’t decided the overall design quite yet. I think we’re going to evaluate several design choices first. However, we plan to go from mobile first to desktop.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hello Foodies,
We think you did a great job with your post for this week. We like how you introduce us in your roles and how you tell us About your personal strengths.

Because we participated at the webengineering Project with you last semester we want to know if you plan a complete new design for the application. Maybe you already thought About it or did some layouts..

Kind Regards

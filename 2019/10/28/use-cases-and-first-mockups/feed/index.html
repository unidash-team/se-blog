Hey easyFinancies,

thanks for your feedback, we really appreciate it.

Thanks for the hint, we might rework the UCDs for next week and start off at users side. We just thought we should skip login (etc.) as it was said in the homework description but it makes sense to start at users side. :)
This also includes a better definition in textual form.

Maybe you can check out later this week to see the updated version and let us know what you think.

Thanks a lot.

Cheers

Dear annoua,

first, thanks for the feedback, we really appreciate honest thoughts about our work.

What do you exactly mean by &quot;templates&quot;? We already talked about what it could be but we could figure it out totally.
Could you please give us another short feedback with what you intended to say?

Thanks a lot.

Cheers,

@rawbean (Foody-Team)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hey Foodies,

I really like your actual blog post.

Your mockups are great and look pretty lovely. They make sure that the reader gets the point of what your talking about.

Your UCD is following the right syntax and does clearly describe what happens. But as you are visualizing an Use Case, your diagram should start on the users side.

I&#039;m missing a longer textual description about your Use Cases to get a even better look on what you&#039;r planing and doing.

Cheers and greetings

Nico from easyFinance]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Dear foody-team,

we liked reading your post. Your new UCD looks great.

The Screenshots and the flow charts for the use cases also look good, but we think there are missing the templates for the use cases.

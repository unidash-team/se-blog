Hi Kevin,

thanks for your comment, happy to answer both questions:

We havenâ€™t fully determined which web framework to use yet. Itâ€™ll depend on what we are going to use for Web Engineering II if any of them. Both frameworks are great and probably have their advantages and disadvantages. Angular has a lot of business features built-in, like dependency injection, HTTP client, and many more, though it can be really overwhelming to begin with. React is mostly dedicated to the UI itself and more flexible when it comes down to business logic. Itâ€™s way less opinionated than Angular. In the end, itâ€™s personal preference. Iâ€™d probably stick to React for flexibility, but I worked with either one before and I can recommend trying both at least once to anyone. 

As for the database, it depends on whether weâ€™re going to store documents or relational data, but also whether or not your data model changes a lot. MongoDB serves great for documents and for frequent data model changes. For the latter, Iâ€™d probably use MSSQL powered by Entity Framework. 

Hope that answers both. 
Cheers,
Gino]]></description>

Something that I forgot to ask: If you use databases, which one will you use?

Cheers!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hello everyone,

I don&#039;t think I have to add anything here. All necessary items have been mentioned with enough information provided. I guess we can agree that stuff might work out better using modern frameworks. ;)

Just out of curiosity, what makes you pick React over Angular or vice versa?

I&#039;ll be looking forward to future content!

Cheers,

					<description><![CDATA[Hey guys,

first of all, i really like the idea you bring into this project phase. The technologies you suggest using seem appropriate.
I especially like that you plan on using DevOps practices, i think this will come in handy as the project grows.

Looking forward to future updates.

Cheers,
Lukas@KeyCloudTeam]]></description>

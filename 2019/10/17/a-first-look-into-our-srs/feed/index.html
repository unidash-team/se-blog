Hi Lucas, thank you for your feedback. You&#039;re right, we actually haven&#039;t thought about it before. We added rough deadlines to the individual functionalities in our SRS and will determine the exact deadlines later on. If you have further suggestions, please let us know.

Thanks,
Gino]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hello everyone,

Thank you for the hint of checking out Azure DevOps, I will definitely look into it. Like KeyCloud already said it&#039;s a nice idea to use markdown for the use case diagram.

It would be better if you choose different colors in your Use Case Diagram that we can check which features are optional or in schedule for the next semester.

Cheers,

Niclas]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hey Guys,
I really like the structure and clarity of your SRS, good job on that. Also nice idea on using markdown for the use case diagram.
The use case diagram looks decent, however it isn&#039;t quick clear to me how your scope is organized. 
Do you want to implement all the use cases in one semester or am I missing something?
Cheers,
Lukas@KeyCloud]]></description>

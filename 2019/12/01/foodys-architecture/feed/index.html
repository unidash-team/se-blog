					<description><![CDATA[Hello Foodies Team,

you did a really good job in this weeks blogpost.
It was a lot to read haha.

I did not understand everything you wrote, but I think I got your main idea. To me it looks like a normal MVC model for a backend API. It looks like one we did for our backend. Controllers, Models(mostly POJOs) and JSON responses as view for our frontend or in your case your app.

I appreciate your efforts for automated testing. I think it&#039;s really important for dev ops. That is another point that we want to implement for our API as well in the future. So you can be glad that you implemented it already.

I think your design layout looks really nice as well.

Keep up the good work, you did a really good job this week.

Best regards,
Jan from Clairvoyance]]></description>

Hey Nico, thank you for your kind feedback. Good idea - the front end API bindings are still work in progress but we&#039;ll make sure to update this post and add some sort of visualization when we&#039;re ready to go.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hey!
This is probably the most complicated post I&#039;ve read this semester, and I really like it because you go into detail about the technology you use and even referenced some links if one wants to read more.
Your MVC gives partially a good overview, I wished there was also the frontend in there somewhere so you can see the whole picture. I don&#039;t think an IDE can Auto-Generate that, but with some pictures and arrows this can easily be done by hand :)
Other than that your Blog is well structured and written, and your frontend even though is still a static page already looks pretty good.
Best Regards
Nico (bookly)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi Froodies Team,

I enjoyed reading your post really much. You described your current components very detailed even though you don&#039;t have diagrams for every part yet.
I also like that you mentioned not only this weeks requirements but went further and provided an update on several other changes in your project aside from the class-diagrams. 
Your work looks really great so far for me, keep up that good attitude :)

					<description><![CDATA[Hey Foodies,

we love your approach in development. While a lot of developers stick with one programming paradigm (e.g. OOP), because they love it, you decided to go with another concept. That is a very interesting move, so kudos to you.
Your class diagrams look very structured and seem to implicate, that you put thoughts into your project planning.
Regarding your roles, nothing seems to be missing.
We hope to see a lot more progress and are excited for the future development of your application. Until then...

Stay cool. Stay organized.

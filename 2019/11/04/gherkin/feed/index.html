					<description><![CDATA[Hello Foodies-Team,

Your feature files look good to us and cover every important test case.
The scenarios are easy to read and show that you understand how feature files work.

It would have been nice if you added a little preview (e.g. a GIF or some kind of video) of the testing process to show us how exactly your tests work.

Your LogicGame Team]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hey Foodies Inc.,

I think you have identified the core scenarios which your application has to handle. Your .feature file look good so far and you have paid special attention to the various edge cases that can occur.

Keep it going, I look forward to seeing your next blog entries!

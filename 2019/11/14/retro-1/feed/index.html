					<description><![CDATA[Hi foodies-Team,

I like how you visualized your strengths on the Flip-Chart and I think it&#039;s a good first step that you started to specify the tasks you have to do in order to get really started with your practical tasks.
You did a good work in the retro an I wish you a good start.

Cheers,
Marius@Evendo]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hey foodies team,

your flip chart design looks very good. Like you described it is clearly visible that you havent started implementing much yet. Therefore your measurements are very generic but nevertheless fitting to your problem. Your backlog items look good assuming that there is some kind of use case specification behind titles like &quot;Adjust styling if necessary&quot;.

Regards

					<description><![CDATA[Hello guys,
your flip charts are looking really good, one could even think you have redone them before uploading here ;)
Its nice that you noticed the flaws in your work on the project. Thats the first step towards improvement.

Best regards,
The MAPHYNN Team]]></description>

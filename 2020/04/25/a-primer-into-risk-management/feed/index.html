Hi TowerShooterz ;),

thanks for your feedback.
We really had fun creating our post this week. If you are interested in more, we published another post this week, so if you want to check out what we are about to change, take a look at our &quot;Reconnected&quot; blog.

Have a nice one, thanks,

Cheers,

Hi Ted&#039;s Team,

thanks for your detailled feedback.
The pictures are where we wanted them but I can see where your confusion comes from. We should have packed the legend into the matrix picture maybe. We will keep that in mind for our future posts. Thanks.

In our opinion we think that no risk has a higher prio than others because all of the risks shall not occur. So we just want all the risks to be kept in eye. 
Also, we do not have one responsible for one risk as we manage our risk by the whole team. If we take &quot;loss of data&quot; as an example, it&#039;s not the owner or the user, who is responsible not to lose their data but everyone has the responsibility to keep everything straight. Even if the git-server may crash at least two members have the code locally. And that&#039;s our way handling it with every risk.

I hope, I could satisfy you with my answers.

Thanks for your feedback and cya around,

Cheers,

-RawBean-]]></description>

Hi Jonas and unitasks,

thanks for your feedback, we already attached our time tracking. We really missed that out. Thanks for your attentive reading.

Also thanks for your feedback on our risk management post. It was quite fun creating it and we maybe will extend the list in the future.

We really made up every extreme or not extreme risk we could imagine during a short period of time and analyzed them afterwards. Well, it&#039;s most unlikely that the DHBW will close for good, but it&#039;s is generally possible. So we just keep it in the list. 

Cya around and thanks again,

Cheers,

-RawBean-]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hey guys, 

you did a great job by creating this blog post. I really liked the way you introduced your article. I also like the Idea to take a unique color for each risk level in your table. 
The only things I could complain about are already mentioned by Jonas and Ted&#039;s Team.

Kind regards
Tower Defense]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hello there!

Good to see you back on track, let&#039;s hope for some great progress. As Jonas already pointed out, the use case time sheet is missing, please add that.
We think, you switched up the two pics in your post (the matrix is where you say the explanation should be and vice versa), you probably want to fix that. 
We like the risks you figured out and how weighed and rated them (although we think a pandemic isn&#039;t &quot;most unlikely&quot; by now). For a better overview of what is actually most important to focus on, sorting them could help. There&#039;s one question we&#039;re wondering on: who of you is responsible to keep track of what risk? Especially who is responsible for the DHBW shutting down (unclear choice of words intended).

See you in the next weeks, stay home, stay safe and
Stay classy,
Ted&#039;s Team]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hey guys,

I must admit I am quite jealous (the highest form of flattery!) of the content quality on this blog post. You put in a lot of effort and refreshed my knowledge of the content we already had in class. Great job!

We have quite similar risks, however there were some ones that we missed, e.g. we do not expect the DHBW to close for good.

One thing I might have missed though, is the amount of time you spent in each use case. This was specified in the grading criteria and you might want to add that :)

Best regards,
Jonas from unitasks (B2)]]></description>

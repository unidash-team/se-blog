					<description><![CDATA[Hey guys,
good job this week. We don&#039;t have more to say to your blogpost as The Hopper Team said. We are looking forward to see which tool you will implement in future.
You said you will focus on Security and Quality Assurance. Maybe you can add an explanation of these points  to your blogpost.

Regards,
AniflixApp-Team]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Dear Raw Beans Team,
you have written a nice blog. It&#039;s very nice that you explained many different tools and their usage. Even though you haven&#039;t implemented a specific tool now and so could not show refactored code or specific numbers, it would be nice to hear what specific metrics you want to improve. In this context, you could explain at least two example metrics like duplication or complexity.

We are looking forward to your further progress!
Best regards,
The hopper team]]></description>

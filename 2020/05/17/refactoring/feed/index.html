Hey Jonas,

thanks for your kind words. We like to be creative for our posts and code but we also got feedback that it may be too long and that some people won&#039;t read too much text concerning the project.

We are actually revising parts of our refactoring code again and actually added .gitignore in that way so for the next commits there shouldn&#039;t be any .idea folders left.
Thanks for the advice.

Keep it up and stay healthy,

-RawBean]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hey Robin,

don&#039;t worry about your blog posts being a TL;DR - I don&#039;t mind at all and even view it as a refresher.

I took a look at your different Fowler git repositories and you seem to be stuck at different stages at the process (which is perfectly fine). I also enjoyed this exercise, one thing I do want to point out however is that you shouldn&#039;t push any artifacts of your development environment to git (e.g. Gino with his .idea folder).

Other than that nice work - I am looking forward to the next post!

Best regards,
Jonas (unitasks)]]></description>

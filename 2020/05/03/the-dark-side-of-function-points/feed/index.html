					<description><![CDATA[Hey Foodies,
Your blogpost looks amazing. Your function Points look very accurate and your graph is easy to understand. Maybe you could add your Compelxity Adjustement Table to let us see how you calculated your function points

We can see that you spent a lot time on this weeks blogpost and the calculation of the function points. Keep on with this amazing work!

Regards,

AniflixApp-Team]]></description>

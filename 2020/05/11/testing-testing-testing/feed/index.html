					<description><![CDATA[Hey Team Foodies,

I like the idea of using karma for your e2e tests as we are also using Angular with karma and the cucumber tests. I am looking forward to see your implementation of that, feel free to notify us once you update your post :)

Hi Manuel,

thank you for your heads up. We&#039;ve been working on some tests but faced some troubles with Angular and Cucumber along the way. Working on fixing these; we&#039;ll make sure to amend this in the next post.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi,

I like that you&#039;ve gone into more detail about how and how you test. Also, I like the links for additional information. 
I just miss the links to your tests. It would be great if you could add them.
In the Grading Criteria, it says that you need a link to your test plan. You should add this link.

Greetings
